# Integers
First up, let's talk about integers. Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without any decimal points. You can use integers to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's see an example of using integers in Python:
```
print('Integer Examples:')
add_1 = 5
add_2 = 10
print("Addition:")
print(add_1 + add_2)  # Output: 15
print(add_2 + add_1)  # Output: 15

print()

print("Subtraction:")
sub_1 = 5
sub_2 = 10
print(sub_1 - sub_2)  # Output: -5
print(sub_2 - sub_1)  # Output: 5

print()

print("Multiplication:")
mult_1 = 5
mult_2 = 10
print(mult_1 * mult_2)  # Output: 50
print(mult_2 * mult_1)  # Output: 50

print()

print("Division:")
div_1 = 5
div_2 = 10
print(div_1 / div_2)  # Output: .5
print(div_2 / div_1)  # Output: 2

print()
```

# Float
Next, let's talk about floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers are numbers with decimal points. You can use floating-point numbers for tasks such as scientific calculations, financial calculations, and more.

Let's see an example of using floating-point numbers in Python:

```
print('Float Examples:')
add_1 = 5.5
add_2 = 10.5
print("Addition:")
print(add_1 + add_2)  # Output: 16.0
print(add_2 + add_1)  # Output: 16.0

print()

print("Subtraction:")
sub_1 = 5.5
sub_2 = 10.5
print(sub_1 - sub_2)  # Output: -5.0
print(sub_2 - sub_1)  # Output: 5.0

print()

print("Multiplication:")
mult_1 = 5.5
mult_2 = 10.5
print(mult_1 * mult_2)  # Output: 57.75
print(mult_2 * mult_1)  # Output: 57.75

print()

print("Division:")
div_1 = 5.5
div_2 = 10.5
print(div_1 / div_2)  # Output: 0.5238095238095238
print(div_2 / div_1)  # Output: 1.9090909090909092

print()
```

# String
Moving on, let's talk about strings. Strings are used to represent text in Python. You can use strings to store data such as names, addresses, and other types of text.

Let's see an example of using strings in Python:

```
print("String Examples:")
single_quote = 'Subscribe to Pycrafting!'
double_quote = "Subscribe to Pycrafting!"
print(single_quote)  # Output: Subscribe to Pycrafting!
print(double_quote)  # Output: Subscribe to Pycrafting!

print()
```

# Boolean
Another type of variable available in Python is the Boolean variable. Boolean variables can have only two values: True or False. You can use Boolean variables for tasks such as conditional statements and logical operations.

Let's see an example of using Boolean variables in Python:

```
print("Boolean Examples:")
x = True
y = False
print(x and y)  # Output: False
print(x or y)  # Output: True

print()
```

# List
Lastly, let's talk about lists. Lists are ordered collections of objects. They can contain different data types such as integers, strings, and even other lists. Lists are used for storing and organizing data.

Let's see an example of using lists in Python:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
names   = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
mixed   = [1, "Alice", True, 3.14]
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(names)    # Output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
print(mixed)    # Output: [1, "Alice", True, 3.14]
```
